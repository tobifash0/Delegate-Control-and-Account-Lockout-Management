# Overview: Lab 14 Delegate Control and Account Lockout Management
This repository documents the setup and configuration of a home lab environment dedicated to studying "Delegate Control and Account Lockout Management." The focus of this lab is to explore best practices for managing user permissions and account lockout policies in an Active Directory (AD) environment.

## Objectives
- Delegate Control: Implementing and testing delegation of administrative privileges in an AD environment to different users or groups, ensuring least privilege access.
- Account Lockout Management: Configuring and testing account lockout policies to secure accounts from brute-force attacks while ensuring proper exception handling.

## Documentation
In this home lab, we will focus on understanding Delegation Control and Account Lockout. Delegation involves granting a user limited access through Active Directory. To begin, we will create a new user in Active Directory Users and Computers on our Windows Server 2022 VM.
